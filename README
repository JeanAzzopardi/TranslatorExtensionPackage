An extension for Visual Studio that uses adornments in order to translate code written in other foreign language (i.e. Dutch, Italian, etc) to any other language (English, German, Maltese, etc), using the Google Translate Ajax API.This was done when working on a project involving lots of variables and comments written in Dutch.The source code can be found at http://github.com/LordIllidan/TranslatorExtensionPackage and the extensioncan be downloaded from : http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/74ba6388-ecba-4181-a890-efda1e591ba3In terms of design and structure, it was inspired by Codeblog : http://www.devx.com/VS_2010/Article/44073It can be used by rightclicking on selected text, and chosing Translate, or by using Control + T. You might have to configure Visual Studio to disable whatever already uses Control + T, namely the Transpose function.
